# Changelog Management Rule

**IMPORTANT**: At the end of every development session or when completing features/fixes, you MUST update the [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Changelog Format
The project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format with these sections:

### Required Sections
- **Added** - for new features
- **Changed** - for changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated** - for soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** - for now removed features
- **Fixed** - for any bug fixes
- **Security** - in case of vulnerabilities

## Update Process

### 1. For Active Development
Add changes to the `[unreleased]` section at the top of the changelog:

```markdown
## [unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- New feature description

### Fixed
- Bug fix description

### Changed
- Modified functionality description
```

### 2. For Version Releases
- Move unreleased changes to a new version section
- Update version number following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Add release date
- Create new empty `[unreleased]` section

## Entry Guidelines
- Use **clear, descriptive language** that users can understand
- Start entries with **action verbs** (Added, Fixed, Changed, etc.)
- Include **emojis** to match the existing style (üéØ, üêõ, üì±, etc.)
- Group related changes together
- **Bold important keywords** or feature names
- Reference relevant files using `[filename](mdc:filepath)` format when helpful

## Examples
```markdown
### Added
- **üéØ Smart Paw Detection** - Intelligent left/right paw assignment based on keyboard layout in [InputMonitor.swift](mdc:Sources/BongoCat/InputMonitor.swift)

### Fixed
- **üêõ Window Positioning** - Fixed cat position not saving correctly across app restarts in [OverlayWindow.swift](mdc:Sources/BongoCat/OverlayWindow.swift)

### Changed
- **‚ö° Performance** - Optimized animation rendering for better CPU usage in [CatView.swift](mdc:Sources/BongoCat/CatView.swift)
```

## When to Update
- **After implementing new features**
- **After fixing bugs**
- **After refactoring major components**
- **Before committing significant changes**
- **At the end of development sessions**

Remember: The changelog is crucial for users to understand what's new, what's fixed, and what's changed in each version of BongoCat!
